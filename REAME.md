# APIS-OVERSEER

A minimalist honey bee colony simulator in Python + Pygame.

Emergent swarm behavior via vectorized agents, LOD tiers, pheromone trails, resource foraging, and perceptual illusion mechanics. Currently ~25,000 perceived bees at 60 FPS, with ongoing work on visuals, guards, hive entry, and foraging realism.

Explores simulation truth vs convincing perception.
