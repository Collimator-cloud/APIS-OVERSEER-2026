APIS-OVERSEER — Loop Selection & Control

🧭 LOOP DECLARATION

Feature / Topic:
<short name>

Initiator:
<you / agent>

Date:
YYYY-MM-DD

🔁 SELECTED LOOP MODE

Choose ONE. If unsure, default to PML.

☐ PML — Fast Patch Loop

☐ SDL — Full Development Loop

☐ Exploratory Bounce (Pre-Loop)

🎯 LOOP INTENT (WHY — max 140 chars)

<What uncertainty this loop is meant to collapse>

🧠 STARTING POINT

Loop entry agent:

☐ Perplexity (precedents / risks)

☐ Gemini (architecture / feasibility)

☐ Brain (UX / perceptual intent)

☐ Grok (biological realism)

☐ DeepSeek (performance)

⚠️ Starting anywhere is allowed. Convergence is required.

🧩 EXPECTED LOOP PATH
If PML
Brain → DeepSeek → Claude

If SDL
Perplexity → Gemini → Brain → Grok → DeepSeek → Claude

If Exploratory Bounce
<freeform, undocumented until promoted>

🔒 TERMINATION CONDITIONS (CLTP)

This loop terminates and locks when all are true:

☐ Architecture safe (Gemini)

☐ Illusion intact (Brain + Grok)

☐ Performance cleared (DeepSeek)

☐ Implementation unambiguous (Claude)

When locked, further changes require a new loop.

🔄 REGRESSION RULE (IF ISSUES FOUND)

If a red line appears, regress only to the resolving role:

Perf issue → DeepSeek

Illusion issue → Grok

Architecture issue → Gemini

UX confusion → Brain

⛔ Do not restart the full loop unless scope changed.

🛑 SAFETY LIMITS

Max full iterations: 3

Coordinator override: Allowed at any time

No new loop types without retiring one

📌 FINAL STATUS

Loop State:

☐ Active

☐ Converged

☐ Terminated

☐ Escalated

Lock Check:

☐ YES

☐ NO

Design Intent (Non-Rendered)

This template exists to:

Prevent “which loop are we in?” confusion

Avoid unnecessary Librarian/Architect overhead

Make termination explicit

Preserve momentum under fatigue
